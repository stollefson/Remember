  You already forgot why you're here? Oh, that's not a good sign. You may need to get that checked out.

	Oh, you just want to know what this site does? Good point. I guess I'm the one who forgot to tell you first. Whoops. Anyway, Forgetting Something? is basically a to-do site. You can make a list of your tasks on your very own page. Don't forget to come back and check your page, though!
